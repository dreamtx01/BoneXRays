## What factors contribute to a home team winning an NCAA basketball game?

## Executive Summary

From 1985-2019, teams in regular season of NCAA Division 1 Men's basketball games won 92,732 of their home games but only won 47,547 of their away games,and 15,805 of matches played in neutral locations. 

Many articles have explained that the reason for a team's home court success is the presence of fans and the arena, as opposed to the fact that they are simply the better team in a particular matchup. Assuming fans are the reasons for this home court advantage, the odds are already stacked against a visiting team, when playing these basketball matches.

This capstone project attempts to predict what factors contribute to a team winning an NCAA basketball game. 

The dataset used for the regular season matches is for the years 2003 -2019. This dataset consists of 87,366 data points from 350 college basketball games. This dataset includes 34 variables such as number of assists, three-point percentages per game, win and loss records per season , and location of matches played. A summary of the statistics of the top 10 teams for this period is displayed below.

A logistic regression algorithm was then used to build a model, predicting whether a match finishes 0 (home win) or 1 (away win) given input derived from in game statistics.

The results for the capstone show that :

* Home court does give an advantage in basketball games played in the NCAA.
* The logistic regression algorithm predicted up to sixty-nine percent accuracy for home games winning a basketball game.
